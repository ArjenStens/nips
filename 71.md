NUDs
----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines the creation of **NUD**s: _Nostr Unofficial Documents_, which are descriptions of standards and sub-standards that do not pertain to this NIPs repo.

Anyone can create a NUD and they are immediatelly valid as soon as they are published. NUDs have owners and can be modified by these owners at any time, but they can also be forked or reinterpreted by others. However as implementations of these specs mature they will naturally coalesce into some accepted definition and it won't be possible for anyone to change that anymore in practice (even if they change the document, the Schelling point will just move to some other document or other set of documents).

NUDs are defined as [NIP-54](54.md) **kind:30818** events.

They should have a `d` tag starting with `"nud:"` followed by a succinct and identifiable name so they can be referred to in other contexts.

For example:

```jsonc
{
{
  "id": "a7696b56ac2af1db22b3a0caa27a84f01789bdd91d5e9eb497890a9597a0b339",
  "pubkey": "79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798",
  "created_at": 1714659471,
  "kind": 30818,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "nud:ordinals-comments"]
    ["title", "NUD: Ordinals Comments"]
  ],
  "content": "# NUD: Ordinals Comments\n\nThis NUD defines how to comment on Bitcoin Ordinals using Nostr events.\n\nEvents should be of kind 10773 and include a tag in the format [\"o\", \"1928604426675219\"] in which 1928604426675219 is the satoshi number given by `ord`. Aside from that these events follow the rules of kind 1.",
  "sig": "76bc8a799bb1f419a74b177e38ddb372358bc21f074848a8b8f1d9f21fc1d7d1f09ffe9d9fcc41ed7de405e102bb205100aadaa1e51ee54289e58f40ba55a8fd"
}
```

Aside from this NUD events follow all the rules of [NIP-54](54.md).

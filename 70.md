Protected Events
----------------

`draft` `optional`

When the `"-"` tag is present, that means the event is "protected".

A protected event is an event that can only be published to relays by its author. That allows the author to choose who can access their events (either by knowing in advance the relay policy with regards to reads or by means of an external relationship with the relay that is not specified here).

The default behavior of a relay MUST be to reject any event that contains `["-"]`.

Relays that want to accept such events MUST first require that the client perform the [NIP-42](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/42.md) `AUTH` flow and then check if the authenticated client has the same pubkey as the event being published and only accept the event in that case.

## The tag

The tag is a simple tag with a single item: `["-"]`. It may be added to any event.

## Example flow

- User `79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798` connects to relay `wss://example.com`:

```jsonc

## Use cases

- private groups
- private feeds
- optimistic hiding of DMs or other encrypted material metadata

## Why

Many people want to restrict access to some of their data to a closed group: by having, for example, a private feed for paying subscribers.

Even though it's ultimately impossible to restrict the spread of information on the internet (for example, one of the members of the closed group may want to take an event intended to be restricted and republish it to other relays), most relays would be happy to not facilitate the acts of these so-called "pirates", in respect to the original decision of the author.

This NIP gives these authors and relays the means to know when a given event is not intended to be broadcasted to all and everywhere.

## How

The default behavior for relays will be to reject all events with the `"-"` tag. The only relays that should accept these events are those that have been explicitly programmed to enforce write access control for all events with the `"-"` tag.

Authors of protected events would have to have some kind of relationship with some specific relays -- for example, using [NIP-29](29.md) -- that would enable relays to know to whom these events can be served once they're published by the author.

If someone tries to copy the event and publish it to other relays that wouldn't enforce the rules intended by the author that won't work as these relays will reject the event.

In practice there may be relays that accept these "pirated" events, but that isn't different from what happens in the current internet.
